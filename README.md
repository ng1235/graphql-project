This is a starter GraphQL project template. To run it, first clone the repository.

Then, install the dependencies:

`npm install`

The project can be started by the following command:

`npm run start`

The project currently runs based on the data in `test-data.js`. The 'add' and 'edit' functionality does not currently function for multiple tags - this is to be fixed.
